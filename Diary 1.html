                     1) Maintaing a balanced diet: Prioritize a well-balanced diet with a variety of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats.
                        While being on campus, processed foods may seem easier and quicker for students to grab on the go. However, consuming processed foods, sugary, snacks, and fast foods can cause fatigue, low-levels energy, and weigth gain. Therefore meal prepping,incorporating all food groups, and staying hydrated is important in keeping students healthy and focused in their academics.  </p>
