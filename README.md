Project descritption: The Student Diaries is a blog that aims to provide a glimpse of reality, personal experiences, and transformations in NYUAD community. Through these diaries, you will get to explore what it's truly like to be a student at NYUAD, offering guides, advice and personal stories along the way. 
Process: In beggining the process was slightly easier and less complex. However when I wanted to add more features and innovative aspect that matched my vision, it became very dufficult.
Reflection: The concept was to create a relatable experience for students at NYUAD. My expectations and goals were not 100% met because I feel like it was not how I envisoned my blog to be. I hoped for a more creative and immersive website but it was personally harder for me to implement.
